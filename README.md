# Cognition Starter Pack
## Pro Edition

Cause we're professionals.  Or proffesionals. I can never remember.

## Use It

    npm install
    gulp

Now gulp is watching your source dir for changes and serving your SPA at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Hack on the stuff in `src`, watch gulp do its thing, watch your beautiful new baby grow.

## Optionally

Pass things via env vars:

    PORT=4000 gulp

Now gulp is serving your project at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). UH mazing.
